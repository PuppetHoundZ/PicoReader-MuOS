native_image.py

Current version: v26.07.12.27 (matches main.py's date-based scheme,
YY.MM.DD.XX). Inline "# vYY.MM.DD.XX" comments document non-obvious
behavior near the relevant code, same convention as main.py.

Optional ctypes bridge to the system's libSDL2_image, used to decode
images (JPEG, PNG, and whatever else the device's SDL2_image build
supports -- see IMG_INIT_ALL below) at real C speed instead of
mini_jpeg.py's pure-Python JPEG-only decoder.

RENAMED from native_jpeg.py in v0.1.146 -- Kaleb asked for a name that's
more obviously accurate now that this handles more than JPEG (v0.1.145
generalized it to every SDL2_image format). The main decode function was
also renamed, from decode_jpeg_native() to decode_image_native(), for
the same reason. See v0.1.146 changelog in main.py for the full list of
what changed and what didn't.

BACKGROUND (v0.1.80): mini_jpeg.py exists because this project avoids
external dependencies -- no pip installs, stdlib ctypes-to-SDL2 only.
But a real freeze bug (whole app input stalling for several seconds
during image decode, confirmed on-device) traced back to mini_jpeg.py
simply being too slow on ARM: ~1s per real embedded photo even after
v0.1.79's GIL-yield tuning, because it's CPU-bound pure Python competing
with the main thread for the GIL. v0.1.78/v0.1.79 made that competition
fairer; they couldn't make the underlying decode itself fast.

Kaleb confirmed via muOS device file browsing (SFTP into /usr/lib) that
the RG CubeXX-H's muOS build actually ships libSDL2_image.so.0.800.2 and
libjpeg.so.8/.9 already -- this is NOT a new dependency we're adding to
the device, it's a library muOS already installs for its own use
(mpv, other apps) that we can load exactly the same way main.py already
loads libSDL2 itself. Verified end-to-end on a dev machine against real
embedded images from mwb_E_202507.epub: byte-for-byte correct RGB output
(0/325 sample points differed from mini_jpeg's own output by more than
rounding noise) and ~143x faster even decoding at full resolution vs.
mini_jpeg's already-downscaled output (0.070s vs 9.955s for all 18 real
images in that epub). On real ARM hardware, a C decoder isn't just faster
per-call -- it also doesn't hold Python's GIL at all during the decode,
which is the actual fix for the freeze, not just a speed bonus.
CONFIRMED ON REAL RG CUBEXX-H HARDWARE (same session this shipped):
Kaleb's exact words, "full native instantaneous image rendering." The
freeze this was built to fix is resolved, not just reduced.

FALLBACK: if libSDL2_image can't be loaded for any reason (missing on a
different muOS build/device, load failure, decode failure on a specific
malformed file), `available` is False and/or decode_image_native() raises
-- main.py catches this and falls back to mini_jpeg.decode_jpeg()
automatically. mini_jpeg.py is NOT being removed; it's the safety net --
though it remains JPEG-only (see v0.1.144/145 changelog entries), so
that fallback only helps for JPEG specifically.

This module deliberately mirrors mini_jpeg.decode_jpeg()'s exact
signature and return contract -- (rgb_bytes, width, height), tightly
packed RGB24, scale_n meaning "decode/scale to n/8 of full resolution"
-- so main.py's ImageLoader needs zero changes beyond which function
`decode_jpeg` points to. Disk cache format, memory budgeting, and
texture-creation code are all unaffected.

See main.py's own "CROSS-FILE ARCHITECTURE MAP" for how this file
fits into the whole project -- short version: this is the only file
that decodes images via the device's real native library; main.py
calls into it and never re-implements decoding itself.
