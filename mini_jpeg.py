mini_jpeg.py

Stdlib-only baseline JPEG decoder with truncated-IDCT resolution scaling.

Decodes baseline (non-progressive) JFIF JPEGs -- which is what the JW epub
cover/inline images are -- straight to an RGB byte buffer, using only the
low-frequency N x N corner of each 8x8 DCT coefficient block. This trades
resolution (image comes out at N/8 scale, e.g. N=4 -> half resolution) for
a large speedup on ARM handheld hardware with no numpy/PIL available.

Not a general-purpose JPEG decoder: no arithmetic coding, no CMYK, no
12-bit precision. Covers standard baseline sequential JFIF AND progressive
JFIF (SOF2), 4:2:0 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 chroma subsampling and grayscale --
which covers all real-world JPEG encoder output found in JW epub images
(the NWT Bible epub mixes ~3/4 baseline with ~1/4 progressive).

Progressive support (added v0.2.0 of this module): progressive JPEGs
store DCT coefficients across multiple scans (DC first / DC refine /
AC first per-band / AC refine per-band) instead of one sequential scan,
so unlike the baseline path -- which streams blocks straight to pixels
and never holds whole-image coefficient state -- progressive decode MUST
accumulate a full coefficient buffer until all scans are read, then IDCT
once at the end. Memory is kept tight for the 1GB-RAM target device by
storing that buffer as one flat array('h') (2 bytes per coefficient) per
component rather than Python int lists (which would be ~30x larger):
a 600x1200 progressive image costs ~2.2 MB of coefficient state, freed
as soon as rendering finishes. The truncated-IDCT scale_n speedup applies
to progressive images exactly as it does to baseline ones.

Usage:
    from mini_jpeg import decode_jpeg
    rgb_bytes, width, height = decode_jpeg(jpeg_bytes, scale_n=4)
    # rgb_bytes is width*height*3 raw RGB, ready for SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceFrom

Current version: v26.07.12.27 (matches main.py's date-based scheme,
YY.MM.DD.XX -- this module didn't switch schemes retroactively; entries
below predating the switch keep their original v0.2.x numbering as
history, same policy main.py uses for its own pre-switch v0.1.x history).

CHANGELOG
v0.2.0-v0.2.3: baseline decoder (bulk-fill BitReader, 12-bit LUT
Huffman, truncated-IDCT scale_n resolution scaling, DC-only fast path,
DRI restarts, 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4 + grayscale), then progressive JPEG
(SOF2) support (DC/AC first+refine scans, EOB runs, successive
approximation; coefficients held in flat array('h') stores to respect
the 1GB-RAM target, freed per-component right after render), then two
rounds of hot-loop optimization: precomputed zigzag/YCbCr lookup
tables and a hoisted chroma-upsampling coordinate calc. All verified
byte-for-byte identical against reference output across real JW book
images before landing. Cumulative real measured impact on a 750x965
test image: 5.702s -> 2.913s, roughly 2x faster. A real baseline bug
(restart-marker byte alignment after a bulk buffer fill) was also
found and fixed during the progressive work -- see reset_byte_align()'s
own inline comment for the exact mechanism if debugging DRI-related
corruption.

See main.py's own "CROSS-FILE ARCHITECTURE MAP" for how this file
fits into the whole project -- short version: this is the automatic
fallback decoder used only when native_image.py's real native-library
bridge isn't available on a given device/build.

# Progressive JPEG (SOF2) support
#
# A progressive JPEG delivers each block's 64 DCT coefficients spread over
# multiple scans: a DC-first scan, optional DC-refinement scans, AC-band
# scans (each covering a zigzag range Ss..Se of one component), and AC-
# refinement scans that add one bit of precision at a time (successive
# approximation, the Ah/Al fields). Coefficients must therefore be
# accumulated across all scans before any IDCT can run.
#
# Memory strategy for the 1GB-RAM target: one flat array('h') (int16,
# 2 bytes/coefficient) per component, sized to the MCU-padded block grid.
# Blocks live at offset block_index*64, coefficients stored in ZIGZAG
# order (progressive scans address coefficients by zigzag index, and
# _idct_scaled already takes zigzag-order input, so no reshuffle is ever
# needed). int16 is safe: 8-bit-precision JPEG quantized coefficients
# are <= 11 bits + sign even after successive-approximation shifts.
